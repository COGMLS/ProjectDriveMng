# Console Colorized String

This library provides a simple way to use ASCII colors on compatible consoles with custom string data types for C++, allowing set/reset the foreground and background colors. Also is possible to convert common C/C++ string data to custom string and to custom to default data types.

## Known Bugs:

* ⚠ When combining both strings and wide strings in Windows Terminal the custom wide string background color will appear in entire line. NOTE: This behavior wasn’t tested in other terminals.
